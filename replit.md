# Replit.md

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing code structure. The project has not yet been initialized with any specific framework, language, or architecture. This provides a blank slate for development.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

No architecture has been established yet. When building out this project, consider:

1. **Project Type** - Determine whether this will be a web application, API, CLI tool, or other type of software
2. **Technology Stack** - Choose appropriate languages, frameworks, and tools based on requirements
3. **Code Organization** - Establish a clear directory structure following best practices for the chosen stack
4. **Development Patterns** - Implement consistent patterns for error handling, logging, and testing

### Recommended Initial Setup

When starting development:
- Initialize with appropriate package manager (npm, pip, etc.)
- Set up version control configuration
- Establish linting and formatting rules
- Create basic project structure with separation of concerns

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies have been configured yet. When adding dependencies:

1. **Database** - Choose based on data requirements (PostgreSQL for relational, MongoDB for document-based, etc.)
2. **Authentication** - Consider solutions like OAuth, JWT, or third-party auth providers
3. **APIs** - Document any external API integrations needed
4. **Hosting/Infrastructure** - Replit provides built-in hosting capabilities

### Environment Variables

When external services are added, store sensitive configuration in environment variables using Replit's Secrets feature rather than hardcoding values.
